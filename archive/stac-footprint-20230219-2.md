# Defining Raster Footprints for STAC Item Geometries

Accurate bounds in STAC Item geometries are important for returning correct Item searches. At first look, defining the polygon bounds for a STAC Item is straightforward. Simply place a point at each of the four corners:

However, we cheated in the above example. The native coordinate reference system (CRS) of the example image is WGS84 (EPSG:4326), which is the same required in STAC Item geometry object (recall that a STAC Item is a GeoJSON Feature, which uses the geographic WGS84 CRS). Let's take a look at a MODIS tile of data where the native CRS is a custom sinusoidal projection. Simply projecting the  in a projected (non-geographic) CRS?

Note this allows us to model concavities induced by reprojection. This is important, as concavity is not near as simple as convexity....

Per the STAC specification, A STAC Item "...is simply a GeoJSON Feature with a well-defined set of additional attributes ('foreign members')". As such, a STAC Item must contain a `geometry` member that defines the spatial bounds of the data being described by the STAC Item. The `geometry` member, in turn, contains a GeoJSON Geometry object with the point, line, polygon, or some combination thereof, that define the spatial bound.  , which can contain point, line, or polygon definitions, or a collection thereof.  Defining the content of the geometry field for raster data is the focus of this post. For context, here is a minimal Item:

Let's start with a quick look at a minimal STAC Item example.

1. impacts API searches ability to return correct set of Items

```json
{
    "type": "Feature",
    "geometry": "",
    "id": "example-stac-item"
}
```

spatial extent with geographic coordinates in decimal degrees in the WGS84 coordinate reference system.

When creating an Item that describes a raster image, a spatial footprint of the image data must be generated to use for the Item geometry field. We intentionally use the imprecise term "footprint" here, as we are not trying to create a precise vector representation of the data of an image (which could contain as many polygons as pixels in the image!), but we are trying to do better than just a bounding box of the entire image, both data and no data. By footprint, we mean a vector that balances many competing factors, and generally represents a shape covering the data in an image. Figuring out the right parameter values to the methods in the raster_footprint module will usually require some experimental validation, to find exactly the right values for your data, CRS, and use cases.

There are a few properties weâ€™d like to have in a footprint:

The footprint only covers the area on the image only where there is data.

The footprint has enough points to accurately capture the shape of the data in the EPSG:4326 CRS used by GeoJSON.

The footprint does not have too many points, such that it is becomes very large.

Discussion of these properties follows.

We will work with an example raster image with both of these characteristics. The image CRS is the MODIS Sinusoidal projection and contains a large area of nodata.

## Challenges

1. raster data is usually projected, that is, not in the WGS84 CRS required by the GeoJSON specification.
2. raster data may include areas (regions of pixels) that contain no data, that is, pixels with a value specified as "nodata" in the image metadata. In some cases we would like to exclude these nodata areas from our Item geometry.

Along the way, we'll discuss methods for balancing the need for accurately capturing the shape of the data while constraining the number of points in bounding polygon

## Caveat

We are not handling concavity. If we were, an alternative approach would be to reproject the data to WGS84 before extracting the shapes.
